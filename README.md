# Hi there, I'm Marta! 👋
### Computer Science Master's Student at UniPi 🎓

Welcome to my digital space! I'm a passionate coder and a lifelong learner currently pursuing my Master's degree in Computer Science at the University of Pisa (Italy). Here, you'll find a blend of code, creativity, and curiosity.
Yes, another auto-generated readme from ChatGPT that no-one will ever read. But just in case you're that one curious soul who stumbled upon this digital nook, here's a glimpse into my GitHub.

## About Me
👾 **Nerdy by Nature** | 🌸 **Anime Addict** | 🇪🇺 **Europhile** | 🌿 **Green Advocate** | 😄 **Pronouns**: She/Her

Hey there, fellow travelers of the digital realm! Beyond the lines of code, I'm an anime aficionado, a Europhile with an insatiable wanderlust for the continent's hidden gems, and a green advocate who believes in making the world a better place, one sustainable choice at a time.

🌍 **Favorite Destinations**: Strolling through the charming streets of Europe, exploring the breathtaking landscapes of Studio Ghibli, and getting lost in the ethereal world of Spirited Away.

Whether it's crafting elegant code or reveling in the enchantment of Japanese animation, I'm always on the lookout for the next thrilling adventure.
